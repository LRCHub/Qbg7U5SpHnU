[00:10.37] Shut me out, but pull me close
[00:12.85] Kinda loving it, give me your heartache
[00:15.56] Hold me tight, but let me go
[00:17.96] Kinda loving it, look what you started
[00:20.36] Turn me on, then piss me off
[00:22.96] Kinda loving it, got me addicted

[00:44.52] I'm just too weak to stay cool
[00:46.94] Guess I'm a sucker for you
[00:50.30] And I know it's complicated
[00:52.68] But I hate being smart
[00:54.67] So all the things that you do
[00:57.12] Makes me a sucker for you
