The moon was shining in the
night
The house was playing such a
simple song
And as you stole another bite
I know my heart will be at stake
Am I just another victim
Cause I never can resist him
Oh oh no don't go
Your tempting touch is what I
need so much
Dracula la la, I'm a sucker for
your love
When you do-do-do what you do to
me
And you know know know, now I've
got you in my blood
Supernatural love's getting
through to me
Dracula la la, I'm a sucker for
your love
When you do-do-do what you do to
me
And you know know know, now I've
got you in my blood
Don't you know dear count, it's
a mystery
Prima donna I'll be yours
Even though you have your cross
to bear
We'll take the mirror off the
doors
And snuggle in our double tomb
Cause your castle is a nightmare
You've got fancy friends who
live there
Oh oh please just squeeze
I go insane from suffering the
pain
Dracula la la, I'm a sucker for
your love
When you do do do what you do to
me
And you know know know, now I've
got you in my blood
Supernatural love's getting
through to me
Got to get my teeth in you
Necking is the thing to do
Even though they never know if
positive or not
You and I coagulate
Vitalise a dying rate,
Dracula my dear, you know I'm
after every drop
Get into a different vein
R. I. P it's all the same
I was bitten now I'm trapped in
Transylvania
You're the coffin, I'm the key
We tune up in harmony
I'll do anything for you except
for mania
Dracula la la, I'm a sucker for
your love
When you do-do-do what you do to
me
And you know know know, now I've
got you in my blood
Supernatural love's getting
through to me
Dracula-la-la, I'm a sucker for
your love
When you do-do-do what you do to
me?
