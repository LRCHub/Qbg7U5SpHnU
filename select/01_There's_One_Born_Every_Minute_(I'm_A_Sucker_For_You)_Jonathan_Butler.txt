Remember when you said
You were going out with your friends
I must've made thousand calls
Just looking for you
You said you'd spent the night
At your girlfriend's house
But your girlfriend's boyfriend
Was looking for her too
I must have been foolish not to see
The games you were playing on me
I must have been blind outta my mind
I should've just let you be (let you be)

There's one born every minute
That's right that's me
I'm a sucker for you
There's one born every minute
But why?
Why me?
You blow me right off track
I'm a sucker for you

While we were having dinner
At a fancy restaurant
You said excuse me
But I've got to make a call
But then you were seen
Getting into a limousine
Two hours later
You hadn't come back at all
I was fooled
I wasn't cool
You pulled the wool over my eyes
I really shouldn't care
Cause I'm aware
You're known for telling lies

There's one born every minute
That's right that's me
I'm a sucker for you
There's one born every minute
But why?
Why me?
You blow me right off track
I'm a sucker for you

There's one born every minute
But why?
Why me?
I'm a sucker for you
There's one born every minute
I'm trapped
I know I've got to let go
I'm hooked
I know, gotta find it way to let go.
