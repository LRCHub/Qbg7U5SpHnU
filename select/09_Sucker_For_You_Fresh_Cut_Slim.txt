I don't care what they say
I'm a sucker for you
I'm a sucker for you
I don't care what they say
Love is blind, that's true, and I'm a sucker for you
Poison me with your lips, just a gentle kiss, and I'm a sucker for you
Things don't work to plan, and now you're out of my hands, and I'm a sucker for you
Let it slide
I let you slide through my hands, that's not the plan
Let it slide
I let you slide through my hands, now I'm not your man
A fool am I
A fool am I
Thinking I was yours
A fool am I
Thinking now what's the course
Let it slide
I let you slide through my hands, that's not the plan
Let it slide
I let you slide through my hands, now I'm not your man
Take my love and just run away, I don't need it anymore anyway
Take my love and just run away, I don't need it anymore anyway
Let it slide
I let you slide through my hands, that's not the plan
Let it slide
I let you slide through my hands, now I'm not your man
